# QIIME2 + DADA2- Jupyter Labs Demo
## Amplicons Lesson 3a

This is a demo of running QIIME2 in a JupyterLab in the Cyverse Discovery Environment, utilizing DADA2 to call ASVs.

This analysis replicates AstrobioMike's [amplicon analysis tutorial](https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/dada2_workflow_ex#the-data) but by substituting a QIIME2 pipeline.  

Before starting this tutorial, you should:

- have a Cyverse account with the QIIME2 app set up in Discovery environment  
OR
- a local installation of [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/)

You will also need [the modified Happy Belly data files](https://github.com/biovcnet/amplicons-lesson-3-repo) from the data store loaded into your working environment. 

The instructions for setting up these prerequirements can be found at the BVCN amplicons Lesson 3a [page](https://github.com/biovcnet/topic-amplicons/tree/master/Lesson03a).

_____

### Initial steps

If you have been following along with the prerequirements and are working in Cyverse, then you should be able to see the `qiime2_wd` folder in our current environment, which has all of our fastq files in qiime2 format.


Make a 'work' directory where all the generated files for this analysis will go. Move this notebook to that folder as well.


```python
# mkdir work/
```

Recall the difference between running normal Python commands, bash commands (using `!`), and iCommands in the Discovery Environment app:


```python
ls
```

    DADA2_denoising_output	      downloads.stderr.log
    HappyBellyqiime2Demo.ipynb    downloads.stdout.log
    classified_sequences	      export
    demux-paired-end-trimmed.qza  phylogeny
    demux-paired-end-trimmed.qzv  silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza
    demux-paired-end.qza



```python
! ls
```

    DADA2_denoising_output	      downloads.stderr.log
    HappyBellyqiime2Demo.ipynb    downloads.stdout.log
    classified_sequences	      export
    demux-paired-end-trimmed.qza  phylogeny
    demux-paired-end-trimmed.qzv  silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza
    demux-paired-end.qza



```python
! ils
```

    /iplant/home/esuter:
      C- /iplant/home/esuter/BVCN
      C- /iplant/home/esuter/HREMicrobiomeproject2019_LargeFiles
      C- /iplant/home/esuter/analyses
      C- /iplant/home/esuter/export
      C- /iplant/home/esuter/sci_data


If you are coming back here after working on an earlier version, you can upload the previous version of your notebook and all of your files using `iget`. For example:


```python
# ! iget /iplant/home/esuter/analyses/Jupyter_Lab_QIIME2_2019.10_analysis1-2020-05-05-14-09-52.8/work -r

# the -r mean recursive, so it grabs everything in all folder levels below
```

In the Discovery Environment, we will also use a Python tool called qiime2. This is a pre-loaded plugin that let's us view qiime2 graphics in the notebook directly. We need to import this using python:


```python
import qiime2 as q2
# This is now a Python item (instead of bash) and doesn't need to be preceeded by `!`. We will use it a few lines down.
```

### Import fastq files into qiime format


```python
# Import fastq files into a qiime2 qza file format

! qiime tools import \
  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
  --input-path qiime2_wd/qiime_import \
  --input-format CasavaOneEightSingleLanePerSampleDirFmt \
  --output-path work/demux-paired-end.qza
```


### Remove primers 
We want to call the same program as in Happy Belly, cutadapt, but call it from within qiime2 (documentation [here](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-cutadapt)). The [syntax](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/plugins/available/cutadapt/?highlight=cutadapt) is a little different in qiime2 but we want to do the same thing. Here, we want to use the `trim-paired` method since these sequences are paired-end and already demulitplexed.

Check out how to set the parameters:


```python
! qiime cutadapt trim-paired
```



```python
# from forward reads, delete forward primer from 5' end with p-front-f 
# and delete the reverse complement of reverse primer from 3' end with p-adapter-f

# from reverse reads, delete reverse primer from 5' end with p-front-r
# and delete the reverse complement of the forward primer from the 3' with p-adapter-r

# the minimum length (set with --p-minimum-length) should be 215 
# According to Happy Belly, based roughly on 10% smaller than would be expected after trimming 
# I cannot find a parameter in the qiime2 version of cutadapt to a max legnth of 285 (like they have in Happy Belly)

#--p-discard-untrimmed states to throw away reads that donâ€™t have the primers in them in the expected locations.

# run this as verbose so we can see the output:

! qiime cutadapt trim-paired \
--i-demultiplexed-sequences work/demux-paired-end.qza \
--p-cores 16 \
--p-front-f GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA \
--p-adapter-f ATTAGAWACCCBDGTAGTCC \
--p-front-r GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT \
--p-adapter-r TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC \
--p-minimum-length 215 \
--p-discard-untrimmed \
--o-trimmed-sequences work/demux-paired-end-trimmed.qza #\
#--verbose 
```



You can comment out the --verbose option to keep the notebook clean but you can run it to see the results of primer trimming. More than 99% of the sequences get trimmed for all sample files.

### Check quality of trimmed reads
Qiime2 works with special 'qzv' files for data visualizations. To read a much better description of these, see this [page](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/concepts/#data-files-visualizations). 


```python
# Use the summarize function to summarize the trimmed reads
! qiime demux summarize \
--i-data work/demux-paired-end-trimmed.qza \
--o-visualization work/demux-paired-end-trimmed.qzv
```


#### Visualize

<u>If you are working in your local terminal</u>, you can view the above file using the command `qiime tools view demux-paired-end-trimmed.qzv`. An html will pop up with the interactive plot. You can also drag the file directly into [this website](https://view.qiime2.org/).

<u>If you are working in the VICE app</u> in a Jupyter notebook, one of the benefits is that qiime2 visualization tool that we imported above. We can view the interactive plot directly in this notebook:




```python
q2.Visualization.load("work/demux-paired-end-trimmed.qzv")
```



  
  
Click around in the above interactive plot quality scores at different positions, number of sequences in different samples, etc.


From the visualization above, we can see the same things that are laid out in the Happy Belly tutorial: that, for the forward reads, the quality really drops off at about 250bp and for the reverse reads, at about 200.

### DADA2 
Use DADA2 to denoises paired-end sequences, dereplicate them, and filter chimeras, all in one step.

Unlike in the Happy Belly environment, where using DADA2 in R let's you control many of the parameters and is multiple steps, here we just have one DADA2 step, which quality trims, generates the error model, dereplicates, removes chimeras, merges reads,  infers ASVs, and generates the count table all in one step. The drawback is that here we have much less control over the detailed parameters (for example, I couldn't figure out how to set a minimum cutoff read length of 175). Still, let's try to replicate the parameters from Happy Belly as closely as possible:


```python
# Check the documentation on dada2 in qiime2:
!qiime dada2
```


```python
# We are going to use the denoise-paired option. 

# Next check which input parameters we can modfiy in that option:

!qiime dada2 denoise-paired 
```



Let's choose some parameters:


I am going to get as close as I can to the same parameters used in Happy Belly:

- --p-trunc-len-f: we are going to truncate the F reads at position 250 
- --p-trunc-len-r: and truncate the R reads at position 200  
    - Reads shorter than these will be thrown out

- Dada2 also filters out reads using maxEE, a threshold number of expected errors in each read
    - In Happy Belly, they threw out reads if they were likely to have more than 2 erroneous base calls 
    - Here, the documentation says 2 is the default so I won't even put that parameter in. 
    - If you wanted to change it, you would use the --p-max-ee-f and --p-max-ee-r arguments

- I won't be trimming the left side of either F or R reads so I am also leaving out the --p-trim-left-f and --p-trim-left-r parameters

- --p-trunc-q can be used to truncate reads when the quality score drops below a certain threshold. 
    - The default number is 2, which is the value I want so I also won't be assigning that parameter         
- --p-chimera-method: I will also leave the default 'consensus' method

- --p-n-threads I am going to put 0 here, which means: use all available threads.

- --p-n-reads-learn DADA2 tries to estimate how many errors were generated by the sequencer based on an error model. This parameters sets how many sequences go into training the model. Leave the default here as 1,000,000 for now


- --verbose will show us what's happening as it's running.


**Note**: This is a long step and may take a while. Here, on the cyverse computers, it took me about 15 minutes. For a larger dataset, it may take several hours or days and it may be smart to use [tmux](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) incase you lose connection. tmux allows your commands to keep running on the server even if you lose connection (I have not used it here on Cyverse so it's sometihng you would need to inquire with them about if you are having issues).


```python
! qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
--i-demultiplexed-seqs work/demux-paired-end-trimmed.qza \
--p-trunc-len-f 250 \
--p-trunc-len-r 200 \
--p-n-threads 0 \
--output-dir work/DADA2_denoising_output \
--verbose
```

    Running external command line application(s). This may print messages to stdout and/or stderr.
    The command(s) being run are below. These commands cannot be manually re-run as they will depend on temporary files that no longer exist.

    [32mSaved SampleData[DADA2Stats] to: DADA2_denoising_output/denoising_stats.qza[0m


Let's take a look at the results 



```python
! qiime metadata tabulate \
  --m-input-file work/DADA2_denoising_output/denoising_stats.qza \
  --o-visualization work/DADA2_denoising_output/denoising_stats.qzv
```





```python
q2.Visualization.load("work/DADA2_denoising_output/denoising_stats.qzv")
```



Compare the above table to the `summary_tab` table from Happy Belly.  

It looks like we had a few more input sequences, which was probably due to slightly different cutadapt parameters (we couldn't set the max length cutoff) but then the filtering steps here removed several more reads than in Happy Belly. This could be due to the method we used (eg. 'consensus' method for chimera removal instead of 'pool') or some other parameters that we were unable to set through the qiime2 input parameters (eg. setting a min length of 175). Still, it seems that what we have here is conservative, so I am going to continue...

Take a look at a summary of the remaining sequence reads (note- in the outpute of the rep_seq visualization you can click directly on a sequence to send it to Blast)


```python
! qiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \
--i-data work/DADA2_denoising_output/representative_sequences.qza \
--o-visualization work/DADA2_denoising_output/rep_seqs.qzv \
```






```python
q2.Visualization.load("work/DADA2_denoising_output/rep_seqs.qzv")
```



And take a look at the feature table


```python
! qiime feature-table summarize \
--i-table work/DADA2_denoising_output/table.qza \
--o-visualization work/DADA2_denoising_output/table.qzv \
```





```python
q2.Visualization.load("work/DADA2_denoising_output/table.qzv")
```


### Assign taxonomy 

We are going to assign taxonomy based on a reference database. These reference databases are called "classifiers" and drawn from curated databases, such as the one from [SILVA](https://www.arb-silva.de/).

You can dowload the classifier directly or train it yourself. Since the dataset we are working with uses common primers, there are classifiers that already exist.  If you are using other primers, or want to train your own reference database for some other reason, you should follow the instructions on this [page](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/tutorials/feature-classifier/).

Here we are going to use  SILVA v132 as our reference database. This is the most recent qiime2-compatible classifier and is the same one used in Happy Belly. I am just going to download the 16S rRNA v4 (515F/806R) v132 classifier from [here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/data-resources/).


```python
! wget https://data.qiime2.org/2020.2/common/silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza
! mv silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza work/
```

Next, assign taxononomy using the SILVA classifier (this step also takes awhile...)


```python

--i-classifier silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza \
--i-reads DADA2_denoising_output/representative_sequences.qza \

```

That gave an error! It's because I downloaded the newest classifier but we are working in a slightly older version of Qiime2.

Next let's read what the feature classifier does

```python
! qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \
```

And let's assign taxonomy.
The cell below takes a long time to run (>1 hr)...


```python

# Classify the representative sequences
! qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \
--i-classifier work/silva-132-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza \
--i-reads work/DADA2_denoising_output/representative_sequences.qza \
--output-dir work/classified_sequences \
--verbose
```



```python
# and visualize
! qiime metadata tabulate \
  --m-input-file work/classified_sequences/classification.qza \
  --o-visualization work/classified_sequences/taxonomy.qzv
```



```python
q2.Visualization.load("work/classified_sequences/taxonomy.qzv")
```




### Create phylogenetic tree 

Next, we are going to make a phylogenetic tree file with our representative sequences. This is useful for some downstream analyses such as UniFrac.

In QIIME2, you can make an alignment *de novo* or align to a reference tree. To see further description of each of these, see the QIIME2 tutorial [here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/tutorials/phylogeny/).  Here, I will use the de novo approach. 


```python
# make new directory for results of alignment
! mkdir phylogeny
```

Next make a multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT ([documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/plugins/available/alignment/mafft/))


```python
! qiime alignment mafft \
  --i-sequences work/DADA2_denoising_output/representative_sequences.qza \
  --o-alignment work/phylogeny/aligned-rep-seqs.qza
```



Next you want to mask the alignment, which reduces noise from ambigously aligned regions (see qiime2 link above for more detail):


```python
! qiime alignment mask \
  --i-alignment work/phylogeny/aligned-rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-masked-alignment work/phylogeny/masked-aligned-rep-seqs.qza
```


Next is constructing the phylogeny. I will use fasttree here, but there are multiple options, all described in the linked QIIME2 page above.


```python
! qiime phylogeny fasttree \
  --i-alignment work/phylogeny/masked-aligned-rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-tree work/phylogeny/fasttree-tree.qza
```


Next, you must root the tree in order to be able to use it in UniFrac


```python
! qiime phylogeny midpoint-root \
  --i-tree work/phylogeny/fasttree-tree.qza \
  --o-rooted-tree work/phylogeny/fasttree-tree-rooted.qza
```


Note that all of the steps above (mafft alignment> mask> fasttree> midpoint root) could have been run with one command, `align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree`.

### Export

Next, like in Happy Belly, we want to export the major files we generated for downstream analyses: 1) the count table (aka feature table/ ASV table/ OTU table), 2) the fasta file, and 3) the taxonomy file. In addition, I will also export the tree file. These are all in QIIME format (.qza files). We are going to change the format so they are useable by other applications.



```python
! mkdir work/export
```


```python
! qiime tools export \
  --input-path work/DADA2_denoising_output/table.qza \
  --output-path work/export/table
```


The above file is in [BIOM format](http://biom-format.org/documentation/format_versions/biom-2.1.html). You may want to put in in tsv format is you are going to be using it in R


```python
! biom convert \
-i work/export/table/feature-table.biom \
-o work/export/table/table.tsv --to-tsv
```

2) Next export the fasta files with the representative sequences


```python
! qiime tools export \
  --input-path work/DADA2_denoising_output/representative_sequences.qza \
  --output-path work/export/rep-seqs.fasta
```



3) Export the taxonomy file


```python
! qiime tools export \
  --input-path work/classified_sequences/classification.qza \
  --output-path work/export/taxonomy
```


4) And lastly the tree file


```python
! qiime tools export \
  --input-path work/phylogeny/fasttree-tree-rooted.qza \
  --output-path work/export/exported-tree
```


### Save

And that's it! Our results files are all in the 'export' folder. You can dowload these directly to your local computer by right-clicking on the folder object on the left. You can also go back to the Discovery Environment and select "Complete and Save Outputs," which will save these files to your 'Analyses' folder in the data store. To make sure you get everything you need, I recommend adding files to your data store using the iCommands. 

I will add my 'work' folder and my notebook to my Data Store using iCommands as an example:


```python
! iput -r work/ 
```

    Running recursive pre-scan... pre-scan complete... transferring data...

```python
! iput HappyBellyDemo.ipynb
```
